# Data_Experiment
## ðŸ§ª Experiments and Tests

This repository brings together various experiments, technical tests, and theories that I develop as part of my learning process in data science and artificial intelligence.
Unlike my main portfolio, here you'll find unfinished projects, ideas under exploration, or exercises that help me practice specific skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To document my exploration and practice process.

To test new methodologies, techniques, and workflows.

To create a database of ideas that can become portfolio projects in the future.

## ðŸ“‚ Content

Each folder contains a different experiment, accompanied by its main notebook or script:

f1_climate_comparison/ â†’ Union and preliminary analysis of four datasets of contrasting climates on Formula 1 circuits.

## ðŸš¦ Important Note

These experiments do not represent completed projects. Some datasets may be incomplete or not thoroughly cleaned, as the primary goal is to explore, practice, and learn.
