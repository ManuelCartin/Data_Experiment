# F1 Climate Comparision 
## 🌦️ F1 Climate Comparison

This experiment seeks to unify and analyze climate data from four Formula 1 circuits located in very different contexts:

Durbuy (Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium) 30 KM from the circuit

Manama (Bahrain Circuit) 30 KM from the circuit

Miami (Miami GP Circuit, USA)

Singapore (Marina Bay Street Circuit)

## 🎯 Objective

To explore how the climate varies between nearby or representative circuits and to practice:

Data cleaning → handling missing values, duplicates, and different formats.

Dataset integration → combining diverse sources into a unified dataset.

Preliminary comparative analysis → observing differences in temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.

## 📂 Contents

data_raw/ → original datasets per circuit.

data_clean/ → cleaned and standardized version of each dataset.

notebooks/ → cleaning, joining, and initial analysis processes.

dataset_final.csv → consolidated dataset for future analysis.

## 🚦 Note

This is a practice project. The data may not be completely cleaned or optimized for final analysis, but it reflects the process of data wrangling and joining heterogeneous sources.
